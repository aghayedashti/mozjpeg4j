# MozJpeg4J
This project is based on Mozilla JPEG Encoder (MozJpeg). The original project is written in C and provides a Java 
wrapper with the expectation to find a compiled library in the system. MozJpeg4J improves the use in Java by including
a set of pre-compiled libraries for Windows, Linux, and Mac, and improves the Java wrapper by loading the needed 
library and providing utility classes for image compression.
